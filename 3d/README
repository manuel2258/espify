All Files should be printable without support!

Layerheights I used are:
0.1mm for the keys
0.25mm for the case

But I'm sure that you can use what ever settings best suits you.

Also the mounting backplate was designed to work with a Razer BlackWidow Chroma V2.
However you can modify the mount_leg and mount_plate to fit your setup!

If there are any other questions or problems please let me know: manuel2258@protonmail.com
